# Tutango: Online Tutoring Application UI/UX Project

This is a UI/UX Design project created as a **Product Design Assignment** for a tutoring platform.  
Tutango is a mobile-first platform designed to make the matchmaking process between learners and tutors engaging, efficient, and fun.  
It addresses the challenge where learners struggle to find the right tutor who fits their unique needs, while tutors find it hard to showcase their expertise effectively.

In this project, I designed key screens and user flows for both learners and tutors â€” ensuring clarity, usability, and visual appeal while minimizing friction in their journeys.
